# SnippetCode
My Own Little Snippet Code Storage

After completing a project with a small group designing a Snippet Code web app called CodeVault, I decided I would like to reattempt it, but this time focus on Javascript and API capabilities for practice.

This application will be designed using Django & Python with a little javascript (hopefully). 

This application will be structured off of several small applications that we have completed as groups, but mainly following the Django Tutorial [MDN Django Tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django). This was easy to follow as well as adapt small changes from others as a good "go-to" example.
